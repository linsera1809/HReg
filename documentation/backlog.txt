- 500 internal server error ---> what to display to user, what to log
- log any time changes made to database and who made those changes

==============================
==== Team Related Backlog ====
==============================
- Status of team after they register (saved, pending, confirmed, denied, warning)
- Saved application, how do we represent this in the database?
- Status of team member (pending, confirmed)
- Warning, team member has left and you have too few members (notify leader &
  members with an email and site notification), change to denied after
- Denied email to team leader if not enough members confirmed
- Resend email for member button
- Notify user that a team has added them with option to confirm
- Team lead assigns can assign new team lead (new team lead must have an account)
- Button for user to leave a team (team lead must assign a new lead before they
  can leave)
- Remove team button
- Team registration errors
  - Member already belongs to a team
  - Person creating team is not team lead --> what should we do?
  - Is registration Open (Registration date and number of teams)
  - Can Edit teams even if registration is closed due to max teams
  - Person editing form is editing only the parts that they are allowed to.
  - User submitting form must have listed themselves as a member of the team
- api/admin for admin requests and there error handeling
- team member was added on many teams as pending, member accepted one, all other
  teams need notified that the member is no longer eligable to join their team
- Team queue for teams to maybe get in if another team leaves. Empties the
morning of hackathon.
- Confirm that the user making changes to the team is authorized
- Allow applications to be in a saved status
- Record who registred the team/saved the team
- Array of edits, who made an edit, when was the edit made, what fields were edited
- When a team member confirms membership, remove them from all other teams. Also
  remove any saved application they may have.
- Person who registers team should be considered the team leader
- Edge case, team leader leaves team and no other members are confirmed
